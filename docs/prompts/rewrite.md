When I request you rewrite the whole file. Please
- Adhere to coding standards
- Adhere to commenting standards (in particular do not include any internal dialogue "thinking comments" in the code)
- Include ALL code in the file. Never snip out code. As an example there should not be comments like `// rest of code here...` or `// leave this function as is...`
