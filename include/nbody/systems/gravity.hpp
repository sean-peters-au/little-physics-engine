 * @brief Basic gravitational force system for physics simulation
 *
 * This system implements a simple uniform gravitational field that applies
 * a constant downward acceleration to all entities with mass. It's a basic
 * approximation suitable for small-scale simulations where gravitational
 * variations are negligible.
 * 
 * Required components:
 * - ParticlePhase (for identification)
 * - Velocity (to modify)
 * - Mass (for future extensibility)
